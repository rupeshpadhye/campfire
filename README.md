## Inspiration
After the pandemic, most of the companies are forced to work in remote setup, many companies declared the remote-first approach. The notable consequences were

The productivity of people is increased but overall satisfaction was decreased as there were no watercooler discussions, knowing team members at lunches, fun events
People are scared to switch to the remote-first company is because of uncertainty with whom they are interacting, what is the company culture.
No show of new joiners at joining dates
